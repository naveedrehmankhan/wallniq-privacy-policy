1️⃣ <b>Information We Collect</b>
WallNiq respects your privacy. We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as name, email address, phone number, or location. 
The app may collect limited anonymous usage data (such as app performance and crash reports) to help us improve user experience and stability.

2️⃣ <b>Permissions</b>
WallNiq requests certain permissions only to provide core features. Storage permission is required to download wallpapers to your device, and wallpaper access is required to set images as your home or lock screen. 
These permissions are used strictly for functionality and never for data tracking.

3️⃣ <b>Third-Party Services</b>
WallNiq uses trusted third-party services such as Google AdMob to display advertisements. 
These services may collect non-personal data, including device information and advertising identifiers, to show relevant ads and measure performance. 
WallNiq does not control how third-party services use their data. You are advised to review Google’s privacy policy for more information.

4️⃣ <b>Data Security</b>
We take reasonable measures to protect user data. WallNiq does not sell, trade, or rent user information to any third party. 
All downloads and app interactions are handled securely within the application environment.

5️⃣ <b>Age & Audience</b>
WallNiq is designed for a general audience and can be used by anyone. 
However, it is recommended for users aged 13 and above to ensure a safe and responsible experience with wallpapers and advertisements.

6️⃣ <b>Policy Updates</b>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in features, legal requirements, or improvements. 
Any updates will be posted on this page. Continued use of the app means you accept the revised policy.
